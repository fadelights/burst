/* The `io` module is part of the standard library (`std`).
You import it using the notation `std::io` and access it's
functions using the same notation; e.g. `io::stdin()`.

If we don't want to import a module, we can still use its
functions by using the full specifier: `std::io::stdin()`

To import multiple modules from the same library, you can use
the {} notation as shown below. */
