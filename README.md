# BURST!

**Begin Using Rust!**

---

This repository will contain my notes and source codes written
while going through "The Rust Programming Language" book
available [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Usage
Each numbered directory is a separate Cargo project designed
to highlight a specific Rust feature. There will be source
codes along with a `notes.md` file accompanying the
code for some necessary explanations. If you want to compile
and run a project, switch to that directory using `cd` and
simply run `cargo run`.
